# My First Agent Project



A personal landing page built using agentic engineering during Agentics 101.



## Overview

It is an index.html file explaining who I am.



## Built With

- AI Agent: Claude.ai

- Method: Specification-driven development

- Human Role: Supervisor and reviewer



## Process

- Module 1: Wrote 10-line micro-spec

- Module 2: Enhanced with hex codes and measurements

- Module 3: Set up GitHub repository

- Module 4: Generated code via agent

- Iterations: 2 rounds of feedback

- Time to completion: 90 minutes



## What I Learned

- Clear specs eliminate AI ambiguity

- Manual review builds supervision skills

- Directive feedback produces accurate results



## Live Demo
