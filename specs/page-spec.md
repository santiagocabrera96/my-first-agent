Project: Create a personal landing page
What it is: Generate a minimal, text-first personal landing page using personal-context.md to communicate who I am, what I’m focused on, and how I think.
Main parts: Hero / Identity – who I am, what I do, and my current direction or focus.
Main parts: What I’m Building / Learning – the concrete systems or technical areas I’m actively working on.
Main parts: How I Think / Work – my approach to problem-solving, learning, and building systems.
Main parts: Contact / Now – how to reach me and what kinds of conversations or collaboration I’m open to.
Style rules: Single-column layout, generous whitespace, readable line length, clear hierarchy.
Style rules: One sans-serif font, neutral background, dark text, one subtle accent color, no visual noise.
Success criteria: A visitor understands who I am and my direction within 10 seconds.
Success criteria: The page fits in 1–2 scrolls and feels accurate, calm, and shareable.
