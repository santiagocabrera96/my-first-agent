Personal Context Summary

I am a software engineer with a strong focus on Clojure, the JVM, and understanding systems end to end. My primary interest is not just writing code, but deploying complete ideas into production and deeply understanding what happens underneath—network calls, observability, telemetry, performance, and security.

In 2026, my main technical goal is to build and deploy a full production system from scratch using Clojure and Datomic, including:
•	Setting up cloud infrastructure (starting from an empty AWS account)
•	Building and packaging a JVM application
•	Deploying and operating it
•	Creating and connecting to a Datomic database
•	Instrumenting the system for observability
•	Understanding data formats and binary protocols (e.g., Fressian)

I value clarity, depth, and first-principles understanding over speed or abstraction. I prefer simple, explicit systems and minimal designs that reveal how things work rather than hiding complexity.

My problem-solving approach is influenced by Theory of Constraints (inspired by The Haystack Syndrome by Eliyahu M. Goldratt), and I tend to focus on identifying bottlenecks, reducing noise, and improving flow.

I care about long-term learning, technical craftsmanship, and building things that are correct, understandable, and maintainable. I prefer concise communication and calm, precise language.

Outside of pure technical work, I value meaningful relationships, consistency, and sustainable daily routines. My ideal workday includes deep focus, structured time blocks, and steady progress rather than constant context switching.

I am interested in thoughtful collaboration, learning-focused discussions, and building real systems—not hype-driven projects or purely marketing-oriented work.
